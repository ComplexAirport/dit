## TODO

### Core
- [ ] Add merging logic. This may require implementing a `diff` logic first.
- [ ] Add ignore file support
- [ ] Add logging
- [ ] Add configuration support
- [ ] Add some system to notify CLI and other clients of possible warnings, etc.

### CLI
- [ ] Add unified output support. Instead of doing `println!(...)`, use something like `success!(...)`, or `warning!(...)`, etc.
